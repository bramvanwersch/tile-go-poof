Windows (MinGW)

    Download mingw development libraries from http://www.libsdl.org/ (SDL2-devel-2.0.x-mingw.tar.gz).

    Unpack to a folder of your choosing (You can delete it afterwards).

    Copy all lib files from

        SDL2-devel-2.0.x-mingw\SDL2-2.0.x\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib

    to (for Rust 1.6 and above)

        C:\Program Files\Rust\lib\rustlib\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\lib

    or to (for Rust versions 1.5 and below)

        C:\Program Files\Rust\bin\rustlib\x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\lib

    or to your library folder of choice, and ensure you have a system environment variable of

        LIBRARY_PATH = C:\your\rust\library\folder

    For Rustup users, this folder will be in

        C:\Users\{Your Username}\.rustup\toolchains\{current toolchain}\lib\rustlib\{current toolchain}\lib

Where current toolchain is likely stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.

    Copy SDL2.dll from

        SDL2-devel-2.0.x-mingw\SDL2-2.0.x\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin

    into your cargo project, right next to your Cargo.toml.

    When you're shipping your game make sure to copy SDL2.dll to the same directory that your compiled exe is in, otherwise the game won't launch.
